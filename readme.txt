pip install pandas:

This installs the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames for handling and analyzing structured data, such as CSV files.
import pandas as pd:

This imports the pandas library and gives it an alias (pd) for easier usage throughout the code.
hd = pd.read_csv('./diabetes.csv'):

This reads a CSV file (in this case, diabetes.csv) and loads it into a pandas DataFrame named hd. The DataFrame will contain all the data from the CSV file.
hd.head():

This command returns the first 5 rows of the DataFrame hd. Itâ€™s useful to quickly inspect the data loaded into the DataFrame.
df.info():

This provides summary information about the DataFrame df, such as the number of non-null entries in each column, the column types (e.g., integer, float), and the memory usage.
X = df.drop(columns=["Outcome"]):

This drops the Outcome column from the DataFrame df and stores the resulting DataFrame (which contains all other columns except Outcome) in the variable X. This is typically done when you want to separate the features (input variables) from the target variable.
y = df["Outcome"]:

This extracts the Outcome column from the DataFrame df and assigns it to the variable y, which is typically the target variable (the one you are trying to predict).
pip install scikit-learn:

This installs the scikit-learn library, which is used for machine learning in Python. It contains tools for model training, evaluation, and testing.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split:

This imports the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. It is used to split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2):

This splits the data into training and testing sets:
X_train and y_train are the features and target variable for training.
X_test and y_test are the features and target variable for testing.
test_size=0.2 means 20% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 80% will be used for training.
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression:

This imports the Logistic Regression model from scikit-learn. Logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems.
LR = LogisticRegression():

This creates an instance of the logistic regression model and assigns it to the variable LR.
LR.fit(X_train, y_train):

This trains the logistic regression model LR using the training data (X_train for features and y_train for the target variable).
LR.predict(X_test):

This makes predictions on the test data (X_test) using the trained logistic regression model LR. The output will be an array of predicted values for the Outcome variable.
y_pred = LR.predict(X_test):

This stores the predictions from the previous step into the variable y_pred, which will be used for evaluation and comparison with the true values (y_test).
